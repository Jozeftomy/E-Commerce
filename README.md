This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

Project Progress Update â€“ Day 1
Today marks the initial stage of development for my e-commerce website. The focus was on setting up the foundational UI elements and creating a consistent design language across key components. Here's what was accomplished:

Navigation Bar (Navbar):
Designed a rough layout for the main site navigation.
Includes placeholders for key sections such as Home, Products, About, and Contact.
Ensures easy scalability for adding categories or dropdowns later.

Footer Section:
Drafted a simple but structured footer.
Contains basic links (e.g., Privacy Policy, Terms of Service), social media icons, and contact info placeholders.
Designed with responsiveness in mind for future optimization.

Login Page:
Created a basic login interface.
Includes fields for email/username and password, along with a login button.
Set up a consistent styling approach aligned with the site's theme.

Registration Page:
Built a user registration form with essential fields (name, email, password, confirm password).
Styled similarly to the login page for a unified user experience.
Prepared for backend integration with form validation to be added later.

Design Consistency:
Established a basic but cohesive visual style across all pages.
Reused components and layout patterns to maintain a uniform look and feel.
Focused on simplicity to allow for quick iteration and enhancements in future stages.
